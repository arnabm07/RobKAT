Title: Robust Kernel Association Testing
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Arnab", "Maity", email = "amaity@ncsu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package implements various robust kernel machine association
				test procedures. Standard kernel association tests often assume that the 
				errors are normaly distributed. When this assumption is not satisfied, standard
				association tests may drastically lose power. In contarst, robust kernel 
				association tests allows for non-normal errors including heavy-tailed, skewed 
				and bimodal distributions.
